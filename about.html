      <h3>Young Life</h3>
      <div style="color:red;">
        <p> I was born in New York.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="color:blue;">
        <p> I was raised in Virginia</p>
      </div>
        <p> Before we moved to Virginia we lived in South Carolinia.
          We lived there for five years. We lived in two towns in 
          South Carolinia. We lived in Anderson for most of the time. We've 
          lived in Greenwood which is a small, very small, town in South Carolinia.
          Then we moved to Anderson. This is where I went to elementary school 
          from third grade all the way to my middle school year of eighth grade.

      <h4>Other Information About Me</h4>
      <div> 
        <p> I have five sisters. One is older than me and the rest are younger than me. 
          My youngest sister is probably my favorite though. I honestly dont know why she is my 
          favorite but she is. Then second would have to be my older sister.
          I am fifteen and I turn sixteen on January fifth. 
          My favorite color is blue. I like to cook but dont like to cook. 
          It's like I like to cook when I want to. If I'm not in the mood to cook 
          I literally won't. I live in Roanoake Virginia. It's a ok place to live.
          I'd rather live in New York, but Virginia is also fine. I'm terrified of animals. 
          Literally any animal. I can tolerate like birds and small animals, but dogs and cats
          I will literally change my whole route to avoid them.
