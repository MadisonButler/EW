      <h4> School Work </h4>
    </div>
        <p> School has never been hard to me to be honest. I am a sophomore 
            in high school. I'm usually a straight A student. 
            I'm taking seven classes at the moment; Spanish II, Health 
            and PE II, Algebra II, English 10, World History II,
            Economics/Personal Finance, and Biology I.
            I took Algerba I in eighth grade that's why I'm in 
            Algebra II so early. Usually tenth graders are supposed to take Geometry,
            which I literally hated, but due to me taking it in ninth
            I'm a year ahead in my math classes. Out of all the classes I take 
            I would definitely have to say Economics is my 
            favorite class. I used to love math and now I hate it. At the moment I 
            have an A in every class except Alebra II; I have a high B. 
            I've been trying to get an A in that class since we started school.

        <h4> Coding </h4>
    </div>
        <p> Coding isn't really hard. It's time consuming. You have to take your time
            to make sure that your putting the right things in the right place. 
            If you mess up during your code than more than likely you will have to start
            over. Then that would be fustrating because that would've been a waste of time. 
            I haven't really had any major problems learning how to code so far, but that'll
            probably change soon. I've learned a good amount of things in the past weeks that
            I've been doing this.
