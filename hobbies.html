    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
</div>
    <p>I don't really have any hobbies for real. I guess 
        one of my hobbies would be cooking. If I do cook it's extremely 
        rare. I can make a some good pasta. I can really make any kind of 
        pasta with any kind of meat to be honest. I've learned to classic
        meals like spaghetti, hot dogs, shrimp, just to name a few. 
        I also play the game with my siblings. We play the playstation, 
        we have a WII, and even a Nintendo Switch. I really only play the 
        playstation, but if they ask me to play with them I wont tell them
        no.
